    "\n",
    "Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\n",

    "### Approach 3: Using stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing the largest bar upto an index as in Approach 2, we can use stack to keep track of the bars that are bounded by longer bars and hence, may store water. Using the stack, we can do the calculations in only one iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep a stack and iterate over the array. We add the index of the bar to the stack if bar is smaller than or equal to the bar at top of stack, which means that the current bar is bounded by the previous bar in the stack. If we found a bar longer than that at the top, we are sure that the bar at the top of the stack is bounded by the current bar and a previous bar in the stack, hence, we can pop it and add resulting trapped water to \\text{ans}ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use stack to store the indices of the bars.\n",
    "    - Iterate the array:\n",
    "        -   While stack is not empty and $\\text{height[current]}>\\text{height[st.top()]}height[current]>height[st.top()]$\n",
    "            - It means that the stack element can be popped. Pop the top element as $\\text{top}$.\n",
    "            - Find the distance between the current element and the element at top of stack, which is to be filled. $\\text{distance} = \\text{current} - \\text{st.top}() - 1$\n",
    "            - Find the bounded height $\\text{bounded\\_height} = \\min(\\text{height[current]}, \\text{height[st.top()]}) - \\text{height[top]}$\n",
    "            - Add resulting trapped water to answer $\\text{ans} \\mathrel{+}= \\text{distance} \\times \\text{bounded\\_height}$\n",

    "Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9], the task is to print all possible letter combinations that the numbers could represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is being followed. Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any letters. All the mapping are shown in the image below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Mobile-keypad-267x300.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Input: arr[] = {2, 3} \n",
    "Output: ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf\n",

    "Input: arr[] = {9} \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Approach: Now let us think how we would approach this problem without doing it in an iterative way. A recursive solution is intuitive and common. We keep adding each possible letter recursively and this will generate all the possible strings.\n",
    "Let us think about how we can build an iterative solution using the recursive one. Recursion is possible through the use of a stack. So if we use a stack instead of a recursive function will that be an iterative solution? One could say so speaking technically but we then aren’t really doing anything different in terms of logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Stack is a LIFO DS. Can we use another Data structure? What will be the difference if we use a FIFO DS? Let’s say a queue. Since BFS is done by queue and DFS by stack is there any difference between the two?\n",
    "The difference between DFS and BFS is similar to this question. In DFS we will find each path possible in the tree one by one. It will perform all steps for a path first whereas BFS will build all paths together one step at a time.\n",
    "So, a queue would work perfectly for this question. The only difference between the two algorithms using queue and stack will be the way in which they are formed. Stack will form all strings completely one by one whereas the queue will form all the strings together i.e. after x number of passes all the strings will have a length of x.\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the given number is \"23\", \n",
    "then using queue, the letter combinations \n",
    "obtained will be:\n",
