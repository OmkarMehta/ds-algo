    "\n",
    "Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\n",

    "### Approach 3: Using stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing the largest bar upto an index as in Approach 2, we can use stack to keep track of the bars that are bounded by longer bars and hence, may store water. Using the stack, we can do the calculations in only one iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep a stack and iterate over the array. We add the index of the bar to the stack if bar is smaller than or equal to the bar at top of stack, which means that the current bar is bounded by the previous bar in the stack. If we found a bar longer than that at the top, we are sure that the bar at the top of the stack is bounded by the current bar and a previous bar in the stack, hence, we can pop it and add resulting trapped water to \\text{ans}ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use stack to store the indices of the bars.\n",
    "    - Iterate the array:\n",
    "        -   While stack is not empty and $\\text{height[current]}>\\text{height[st.top()]}height[current]>height[st.top()]$\n",
    "            - It means that the stack element can be popped. Pop the top element as $\\text{top}$.\n",
    "            - Find the distance between the current element and the element at top of stack, which is to be filled. $\\text{distance} = \\text{current} - \\text{st.top}() - 1$\n",
    "            - Find the bounded height $\\text{bounded\\_height} = \\min(\\text{height[current]}, \\text{height[st.top()]}) - \\text{height[top]}$\n",
    "            - Add resulting trapped water to answer $\\text{ans} \\mathrel{+}= \\text{distance} \\times \\text{bounded\\_height}$\n",

    "Approach: Now let us think how we would approach this problem without doing it in an iterative way. A recursive solution is intuitive and common. We keep adding each possible letter recursively and this will generate all the possible strings.\n",
    "Let us think about how we can build an iterative solution using the recursive one. Recursion is possible through the use of a stack. So if we use a stack instead of a recursive function will that be an iterative solution? One could say so speaking technically but we then aren’t really doing anything different in terms of logic.\n",

    "A Stack is a LIFO DS. Can we use another Data structure? What will be the difference if we use a FIFO DS? Let’s say a queue. Since BFS is done by queue and DFS by stack is there any difference between the two?\n",

    "So, a queue would work perfectly for this question. The only difference between the two algorithms using queue and stack will be the way in which they are formed. Stack will form all strings completely one by one whereas the queue will form all the strings together i.e. after x number of passes all the strings will have a length of x.\n",

    "# 14 and 15. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "A trie (pronounced as \"try\") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Trie class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trie() Initializes the trie object.\n",
    "* void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.\n",
    "* boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.\n",
    "* boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "[\"Trie\", \"insert\", \"search\", \"search\", \"startsWith\", \"insert\", \"search\"]\n",
    "[[], [\"apple\"], [\"apple\"], [\"app\"], [\"app\"], [\"app\"], [\"app\"]]\n",
    "Output\n",
    "[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "Trie trie = new Trie();\n",
    "trie.insert(\"apple\");\n",
    "trie.search(\"apple\");   // return True\n",
    "trie.search(\"app\");     // return False\n",
    "trie.startsWith(\"app\"); // return True\n",
    "trie.insert(\"app\");\n",
    "trie.search(\"app\");     // return True\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other data structures, like balanced trees and hash tables, which give us the possibility to search for a word in a dataset of strings. Then why do we need trie? Although hash table has $O(1)$ time complexity for looking for a key, it is not efficient in the following operations :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding all keys with a common prefix.\n",
    "* Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why trie outperforms hash table, is that as hash table increases in size, there are lots of hash collisions and the search time complexity could deteriorate to $O(n)$, where n is the number of keys inserted. Trie could use less space compared to Hash Table when storing many keys with the same prefix. In this case using trie has only $O(m)$ time complexity, where mm is the key length. Searching for a key in a balanced tree costs $O(m \\log n)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asked in Google, Amazon, Twitter, Microsoft, Snapchat, Oracle, Apple, Opendoor.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trie node structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Trie is a rooted tree. Its nodes have the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum of RR links to its children, where each link corresponds to one of RR character values from dataset alphabet. In this article we assume that RR is 26, the number of lowercase latin letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boolean field which specifies whether the node corresponds to the end of the key, or is just a key prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Insertion of a key to a trie\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert a key by searching into the trie. We start from the root and search a link, which corresponds to the first key character. There are two cases :\n",
    "\n",
    "A link exists. Then we move down the tree following the link to the next child level. The algorithm continues with searching for the next key character.\n",
    "\n",
    "A link does not exist. Then we create a new node and link it with the parent's link matching the current key character. We repeat this step until we encounter the last character of the key, then we mark the current node as an end node and the algorithm finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity : O(m)O(m), where m is the key length.\n",
    "In each iteration of the algorithm, we either examine or create a node in the trie till we reach the end of the key. This takes only mm operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity : O(m)O(m).\n",
    "In the worst case newly inserted key doesn't share a prefix with the the keys already inserted in the trie. We have to add mm new nodes, which takes us O(m)O(m) space.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Search for a key in a trie\n",
    "Each key is represented in the trie as a path from the root to the internal node or leaf. We start from the root with the first key character. We examine the current node for a link corresponding to the key character. There are two cases :\n",
    "\n",
    "A link exist. We move to the next node in the path following this link, and proceed searching for the next key character.\n",
    "\n",
    "A link does not exist. If there are no available key characters and current node is marked as isEnd we return true. Otherwise there are possible two cases in each of them we return false :\n",
    "\n",
    "There are key characters left, but it is impossible to follow the key path in the trie, and the key is missing.\n",
    "No key characters left, but current node is not marked as isEnd. Therefore the search key is only a prefix of another key in the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity : O(m)O(m) In each step of the algorithm we search for the next key character. In the worst case the algorithm performs mm operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity : O(1)O(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Search for a key prefix in a trie\n",
    "The approach is very similar to the one we used for searching a key in a trie. We traverse the trie from the root, till there are no characters left in key prefix or it is impossible to continue the path in the trie with the current key character. The only difference with the mentioned above search for a key algorithm is that when we come to an end of the key prefix, we always return true. We don't need to consider the isEnd mark of the current trie node, because we are searching for a prefix of a key, not for a whole key.\n",

For example, another topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 3 1 0”. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).\n",

For example, in the given graph, the vertex ‘5’ should be printed before vertex ‘0’, but unlike DFS, the vertex ‘4’ should also be printed before vertex ‘0’. So Topological sorting is different from DFS. For example, a DFS of the shown graph is “5 2 3 1 0 4”, but it is not a topological sorting.\n",

In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We don’t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack. \n",

    "# 20. Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, find order of characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Input:  words[] = {\"baa\", \"abcd\", \"abca\", \"cab\", \"cad\"}\n",
    "Output: Order of characters is 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c'\n",
    "Note that words are sorted and in the given language \"baa\" \n",
    "comes before \"abcd\", therefore 'b' is before 'a' in output.\n",
    "Similarly we can find other orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:  words[] = {\"caa\", \"aaa\", \"aab\"}\n",
    "Output: Order of characters is 'c', 'a', 'b'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to create a graph of characters and then find topological sorting of the created graph. Following are the detailed steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a graph g with number of vertices equal to the size of alphabet in the given alien language. For example, if the alphabet size is 5, then there can be 5 characters in words. Initially there are no edges in graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Do following for every pair of adjacent words in given sorted array. \n",
    "\n",
    "…..a) Let the current pair of words be word1 and word2. One by one compare characters of both words and find the first mismatching characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "…..b) Create an edge in g from mismatching character of word1 to that of word2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Print topological sorting of the above created graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: The first step to create a graph takes O(n + alpha) time where n is number of given words and alpha is number of characters in given alphabet. The second step is also topological sorting. Note that there would be alpha vertices and at-most (n-1) edges in the graph. The time complexity of topological sorting is O(V+E) which is O(n + alpha) here. So overall time complexity is O(n + alpha) + O(n + alpha) which is O(n + alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise: The above code doesn’t work when the input is not valid. For example {“aba”, “bba”, “aaa”} is not valid, because from first two words, we can deduce ‘a’ should appear before ‘b’, but from last two words, we can deduce ‘b’ should appear before ‘a’ which is not possible. Extend the above program to handle invalid inputs and generate the output as “Not valid”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2: [Works for invalid input data]\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Compare 2 adjacent words at a time (i.e, word1 with word2, word2 with word3, … , word(startIndex) and word(startIndex + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Then we compare one character at a time for the 2 words selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2a) If both characters are different, we stop the comparison here and conclude that the character from word(startIndex) comes before the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(2b) If both characters are the same, we continue to compare until (2a) occurs or if either of the words has been exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) We continue to compare each word in this fashion until we have compared all words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find a character set in (2a) we pass them to class ‘AlienCharacters’ which takes care of the overall ordering of the characters. The idea is to maintain the ordering of the characters in a linked list (DNode). To optimize the insertion time into the linked list, a map (C# Dictionary) is used as an indexing entity, thus, bringing down the complexity to O(1). This is an improvement from the previous algorithm where topological sort was used for the purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The startIndex must be within range\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When comparing 2 words, if we exhaust on one i.e, the length of both words is different. Compare only until either one exhausts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "The method-wise time complexities have been mentioned in the code below (C#) for better understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "If ‘N’ is the number of words in the input alien vocabulary/dictionary, ‘L’ length of the max length word, and ‘C’ is the final number of unique characters,\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(N * L) \n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(C)\n",

    "Given a directed and two vertices ‘u’ and ‘v’ in it, find shortest path from ‘u’ to ‘v’ with exactly k edges on the path.\n",
    "The graph is given as adjacency matrix representation where value of graph[i][j] indicates the weight of an edge from vertex i to vertex j and a value INF(infinite) indicates no edge from i to j.\n",
    "For example, consider the following graph. Let source ‘u’ be vertex 0, destination ‘v’ be 3 and k be 2. There are two walks of length 2, the walks are {0, 2, 3} and {0, 1, 3}. The shortest among the two is {0, 2, 3} and weight of path is 3+6 = 9.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can optimize the above solution using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to build a 3D table where first dimension is source, second dimension is destination, third dimension is number of edges from source to destination, and the value is the weight of the shortest path having exactly the number of edges, stored in the third dimension, from source to destination. Like other Dynamic Programming problems, we fill the 3D table in bottom-up manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity of the above DP-based solution is $O(V^3K)$ which is much better than the naive solution.\n"
