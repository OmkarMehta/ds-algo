    "# 1. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) given that you can eliminate at most k obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/short1-grid.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,0]], k = 1\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10.\n",
    "The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many grid search problems where the goal is to find the shortest path, the key to solve this problem is to apply the Breadth-First Search algorithm, as opposed to the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. In this article, we will start with a classic BFS solution. Then on top of BFS, we will introduce a heuristic (greedy) strategy to speed up the algorithm, which eventually transforms our classic BFS algorithm into another classic algorithm called the A* search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 1: BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we must traverse the grid to reach a target cell, while the grid contains some obstacles. If the problem ends here, one could probably tell that this is a classic grid search problem, e.g. the problem of 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food fits the bill exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the particularity of this problem is that one can eliminate obstacles to a certain extent. This constraint complicates our problem. First of all, if there were no limit on how many obstacles we can eliminate, then the shortest distance to reach the target cell would be the Manhattan distance between the starting cell and the target cell. Likewise, if the quota to eliminate the obstacles is greater than the Manhattan distance, then the shortest distance is guaranteed to be the Manhattan distance. However, we do have a limit on the number of obstacles that we can eliminate along the way. As a result, rather than taking a straightforward path to reach the target, we have to take some detour in certain cases, which implies that we need to explore all possible directions while respecting the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring, we refer to the BFS strategy, rather than DFS. The BFS algorithm works like detecting an object with sonar. A sound wave propagages in all directions with equal speed. At any given moment, all the objects that the sound wave reaches have the same distance to the source of the sound. On the other hand, as soon as the sound wave reaches the object, the path is guaranteed to be the shortest, since the distance is proportional to the time, the more time it takes, the longer the distance is.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_bfs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above intuition of the BFS algorithm, we can rest assured that as soon as we reach the target, the path that leads to the target is the shortest. This is also the rationale for why we should employ the BFS strategy rather than DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the canonical implementation of the BFS algorithm, we would employ a queue data structure to maintain the order of exploration. Each element in the queue normally contains two pieces of information: the current position and the distance traveled so far from the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our problem here, we need another piece of information, which is the remaining quota that we can use to eliminate the obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the coordinates, the obstacle elimination quota uniquely constitutes a state during our BFS exploration. For example, in the following graph, we demonstrate two different paths between the start cell and an intermediate cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_bfs_two_paths.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the obstacle elimination quota, we would only visit the intermediate cell once, while only one of the two paths can lead us to the target, since in one of the paths we don't have sufficient quota to get through. Therefore, it is critical to keep the quota information, so that we can revisit the same cell with different quotas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to implement a BFS algorithm. We provide a template to do so in the Queue and Stack Explore Card.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we provide some sample implementations together with the tweak we mentioned in the above section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break down the algorithm into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main body of the BFS algorithm consists of a loop around a queue, as well as a set called seen which keeps track of all the states visited along the way so that we don't visit the same state twice. A state refers to a unique combination of coordinates and the remaining quota.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At each iteration of the loop, we pop out one element from the queue. The element contains the distance from the starting point as well as the current state which includes the current coordinate and the remaining quotas to eliminate obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within the same iteration, we evaluate the next moves starting from the popped element. Each move results in a new state and the state is valid if it is within the grid boundaries and has not been visited before. Each valid state is pushed into the queue for later iterations. Meanwhile, we also need to mark the state as visited by adding the state to the seen states set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At any iteration, if we have reached our target, we can return immediately from the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: before running the BFS traversal, we also perform a quick check to see if we have sufficient quotas to take the most direct path from start to finish regardless of the number of obstacles. If so, the shortest distance to reach the target is the Manhattan distance between the starting cell and the target cell.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the above BFS approach, one might notice that when at any specific position, we would systematically explore the surrounding neighbors in all four directions, due to the nature of BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the action might seem conterintuitive or sub-optimal. Since the destination is located in the lower-right corner of the grid, in order to find the shortest path, the optimal directions to explore should be either right or down, rather than left or up.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_next_steps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the above image, the optimal steps to explore should be the ones in green (right and down), rather than the ones in orange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one idea to improve our BFS approach is to prioritize exploring the most promising directions at each step. Through prioritization, we can speed up the algorithm by reducing the time spent exploring less promising paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea leads us to the A* search algorithm, which is yet another classic path finding algorithm that uses a heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we cannot exclude (or prune) those less promising directions, otherwise we might miss the correct path because sometimes we have to take a detour in order to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A* (pronounced as A star) is also known as an informed search algorithm or best-first search. Because at each step of exploration, it makes the best and informed decision on the next steps, i.e. it prioritizes the steps that are the most promising. Specifically, this prioritization strategy can be expressed as A* selects a path that minimizes the following function:f(n) = g(n) + h(n)f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "nn: a specific step during the exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "g(n)g(n): the cost to reach the step nn. Here, the cost refers to the distance traveled so far to the step nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "h(n)h(n): a heuristic estimation on the cost to reach the destination from the step nn. Here, the cost refers to the distance ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "f(n)f(n): the estimated total cost to reach the destination if one takes the step nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the defined function, A* algorithm has a deterministic way to evaluate each potential step, and then make what it believes to be the best decision at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem boils down to defining the above functions for our scenario, in order to apply the A* algorithm. Specifically, g(n)g(n) would be the number of steps that one has taken to reach nn. And h(n)h(n) would be the Manhattan distance from nn to the destination, which is the shortest path to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important property of our heuristic h(n)h(n) function is that the function should be admissible, i.e. it never overestimates the cost. Otherwise, it could not guarantee that the path we find is the shortest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the admissible property, let us take a metaphor. In a football tournament, we want to select the best team in the end. If we overestimate the incompetence of a team, i.e. we downplay the potential of the team, we might prematurely disqualify or ignore the team. As a result, we may predict that a not-so-good team will win the championship, while in reality, the team we disqualified or ignored happens to be the best team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm provides a more optimized path selection strategy, on top of the BFS approach. Therefore, we can implement the A* algorithm while keeping the bulk of our previous BFS approach intact. We will still use a queue to keep track of the order of visits. And we will still use a set to keep track of the visited states so that we do not revisit any previously explored paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, here are the modifications that we will make:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than using a normal queue, we use a priority queue to store the order of visits. The order of visits is based on the estimated total cost function f(n)f(n) that we defined. With the priority queue, the step that has potentially the lowest cost will be visited first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each element in the queue, we add one more piece of information which is the estimated total cost to reach the destination at each step. This estimation will be used to prioritize each potential next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We add another heuristic condition that allows us to determine the length of the shortest path without exploration. The condition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * At any step, if the remaining quota to eliminate the obstacles is larger than the length of the estimated shortest path (i.e. manhattan distance between the current step and the destination), then the length of the remaining path is the manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The condition can also be interpreted as if we have sufficient capacity to remove any obstacle along the way, we will simply take the shortest path to reach the destination, without the need for further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We apply the condition at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let NN be the number of cells in the grid, and KK be the quota to eliminate obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity: O\\big(N \\cdot K \\cdot \\log{(N \\cdot K)} \\big)O(N⋅K⋅log(N⋅K))\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct a BFS traversal in the grid. In the worst case, we will visit each cell in the grid. And each cell can be visited at most KK times, with different quotas of obstacle elimination. Therefore, the total number of visits would be N \\cdot KN⋅K.\n",

    "I -- BFS solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the BFS solution is straightforward: we can keep track of all the possible positions of the racecar after n instructions (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) and return the smallest n such that the target position is reached. Naive BFS will run at O(2^n) since for each position we have two choices: either accelerate or reverse. Further observations reveal that there may be overlapping among intermediate states so we need to memorize visited states (each state is characterized by two integers: car position and car speed). However, the total number of unique states still blows up for large target positions (because the position and speed can grow unbounded), so we need further pruning of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "II -- DP solution\n",
    "\n",
    "DP solution works by noting that after each reverse, the car's speed returns to 1 (the sign can be interpreted as the direction of the speed). So we can redefine the problem in terms of the position of the car while leave out the speed: let T(i) be the length of the shortest instructions to move the car from position 0 to position i, with initail speed of 1 and its direction pointing towards position i. Then our original problem will be T(target), and the base case is T(0) = 0. Next we need to figure out the recurrence relations for T(i).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to apply the definition of T(i) to subproblems, the car has to start with speed of 1, which implies we can only apply T(i) right after the reverse instruction. Also we need to make sure the direction of the initial speed when applying T(i) is pointing towards the final target position.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't really know how many accelerate instructions there should be before the reverse instruction, so theoretically we need to try all possible cases: zero A, one A, two A, three A, ... and so on. For each case, we can obtain the position of the car right before the reverse instruction, which will be denoted as j = 2^m - 1, with m the number of A's. Then depending on the relation between i and j, there will be three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "j < i: the reverse instruction is issued before the car reaches i. In this case, we cannot apply the definition of T(i) to the subproblems directly, because even though the speed of the car returns to 1, its direction is pointing away from the target position (in this case position i). So we have to wait until the second reverse instruction is issued. Again, we don't really know how many accelerate instructions there should be in between these two reverse instructions, so we will try each of the cases: zero A, one A, two A, three A, ..., etc. Assume the number of A is q, then the car will end up at position j - p right before the second reverse instruction, where p = 2^q - 1. Then after the second reverse instruction, our car will start from position j - p with speed of 1 and its direction pointing towards our target position i. Since we want the length of the total instruction sequence to be minimized, we certainly wish to use minimum number of instructions to move the car from j - p to i, which by definition will be given by T(i-(j-p)) (note that in the definition of T(i), we move the car from position 0 to position i. If the start position is not 0, we need to shift both the start and target positions so that the start position is aligned with 0). So in summary, for this case, the total length of the instruction will be given by: m + 1 + q + 1 + T(i-(j-p)), where m is the number of A before the first R, q is the number of A before the second R, the two 1's correspond to the two R's, and lastly T(i-(j-p)) is the length of instructions moving the car from position j - p to the target position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "j == i: the target position is reached without any reverse instructions. For this case, the total length of the instruction will be given by m.\n",
    "\n",
    "j > i: the reverse instruction is issued after the car goes beyond i. In this case, we don't need to wait for a second reverse instruction, because after the first reverse instruction, the car's speed returns to 1 and its direction will be pointing towards our target position i. So we can apply the definition of T(i) directly to the subproblem, which will be T(j-i). Note that not only do we need to shift the start and target positions, but also need to swap them as well as the directions. So for this case, the total length of the instructions will be given by m + 1 + T(j-i).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final answer for T(i) will be the minimum of the above three cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "Both the top-down DP and bottom-up DP run at O(target * (log(target))^2) with O(target) space. However, the top-down DP may be slightly more efficient as it may skip some of the intermediate cases that must be computed explicitly for the bottom-up DP. Though the nominal time complexity are the same, both DP solutions will be much more efficient in practice compared to the BFS solution, which has to deal with (position, speed) pairs and their keys for hashing, etc."

The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. The nodes that are located in the ith height will be appear in the ith collection in the final answer.

Since height of any node depends on the height of it's children node, hence we traverse the tree in a post-order manner (i.e. height of the childrens are calculated first before calculating the height of the given node). Additionally, whenever we encounter a null node, we simply return -1 as it's height.\n",

    "Next, we'll store the pair (height, val) for all the nodes which will be sorted later to obtain the final answer.

    "If you've attempted this question and can't figure out why you're getting wrong answers, here are a couple of things to check before reading the article:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation is not a \"reverse\" form of Polish Notation. It is a bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Java, note that the input type is an array of strings, not an array of chars. This means that you should be comparing them with .equals(...), not ==. If your code is working on your computer but not on Leetcode, this is probably why. It is a bug in your code, not in the Leetcode platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages (e.g. Python, but not C++ and Java) do not truncate towards 0 with division, so you'll need to figure out how to make them do so (we'll discuss ways in the article). For example, if we put -121 // 7 into Python, we get -18, but we actually wanted -17. If unsure about your programming language, either check the documentation or simply write a program that does -121 / 7 (as integer division) and see which result you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you put numbers around the correct way? e.g. the test case [\"12\", \"7\", \"-\"] means you should calculate 12 - 7 = 5, and not 7 - 12 = -5. In most implementations, getting them the correct way around is not immediately obvious. If you aren't certain you have it right, try this test case ([\"12\", \"7\", \"-]) and check whether you get 5 or -5.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing this solution article, the Wikipedia article has a number of errors and sections that are confusing (in particular, parsing the list in reverse). Try to understand how Reverse Polish Notation works and then design an algorithm yourself rather than following the provided pseudocode too closely. The Introduction section of this solution article also explains how Reverse Polish Notation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with looking at what it means for integer division to truncate towards zero, and then at what Reverse Polish Notation is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Division between two integers should truncate towards zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Early on in your programming career, you probably learned about integer division. When dividing 2 positive numbers, we always truncate down to the nearest integer. The non-integer values are in parenthesis afterwards for reference.\n",
    "```\n",
    "6 / 2 = 3 (3.0)\n",
    "11 / 5 = 2 (2.2)\n",
    "9 / 5 = 1 (1.8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages do integer division by default (as opposed to float division, where decimal places are kept), and this is how they handle positive integers. Both of the following definitions could be (and are) used to describe the truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The result is truncated to a less than or equal number. i.e. 1 is less than 1.8.\n",
    "* The truncation is towards zero, i.e. 1 is closer to zero than 1.8 is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For negative numbers however, it is impossible to satisfy both of these, so one or the other has to be picked. For example, consider the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "-9 / 5 = ? (-1.8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we wanted the truncated result to be smaller, we'd have to go to -2, as -2 < -1.\n",
    "* If we wanted the truncated result to be nearer to zero, we'd have to go to -1 as -1 is nearer to zero than -2 is.\n",
    "Some programming languages go with the first definition, and others go with the second. For this problem, you are expected to go with the second definition, regardless of what your chosen programming language uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, for example, goes with the first definition. This means that we need to find a way of doing the division. Luckily, the int(...) function does truncate towards zero, and therefore we can use the int(a / b) trick. Note that this is not the same as int(a // b). We haven't checked what all the programming languages available on Leetcode do, so if your chosen programming language is not truncating division towards zero, have a look in the math libraries for your chosen programming language or do a web search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Infix Notation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing Infix Notation provides some great context for understanding Reverse Polish Notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people know how to read expressions written using Infix Notation. Evaluating the following expression is something you will have learned to do in elementary school.\n",
    "```\n",
    "3 + 1 + 9 - 5 = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "This isn't too difficult. However, many of you will also have seen viral posts circulating social media websites, such as Facebook, that challenge you to evaluate an expression like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "5 * 4 + 9 - 2 / 3 + 1 = ?\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you check the comments, among many other strange answers, you'll probably see people arguing about whether the answer is 10, 27.33, or 29.33.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the disagreement is because different people have different understandings about how such an expression should be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who say the answer is 10 evaluated it strictly from left to right, with the following steps:\n",
    "```\n",
    "5 * 4 = 20\n",
    "20 + 9 = 29\n",
    "29 - 2 = 27\n",
    "27 / 3 = 9\n",
    "9 + 1 = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Those who say the answer is 27.33 follow a rule where we evaluate operations in the following order; division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction. This method comes from a common misunderstanding of the widely used mnemonics: PEMDAS/BODMAS/BEDMAS. The steps with this method are as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "= 5 * 4 + 9 - 0.66 + 1 (Do division first.)\n",
    "= 20 + 9 - 0.66 + 1 (Do multiplication second.)\n",
    "= 29 - 1.66 (Do the additions third.)\n",
    "= 27.33 (Do the subtraction fourth.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Those who say the answer is 29.33 use the rules most programming languages use, and that is also the correct interpretation of the mnemonics (PEMDAS/BODMAS/BEDMAS). That is to do division and multiplication first, in order from left to right, and then addition and subtraction, in order from left to right. Their steps are as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "= 20 + 9 - 2 / 3 + 1 (Do the multiplication.)\n",
    "= 20 + 9 - 0.66 + 1 (Do the division.)\n",
    "= 29 - 0.66 + 1 (Do the first addition.)\n",
    "= 28.33 + 1 (Do the subtraction, as it's next.)\n",
    "= 29.33 (Do the last addition.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Most mathematicians would agree that the correct answer is 29.33. Yet, this is probably not the answer you'd get if you asked a random sample of people in the general public (just look at the Facebook posts!). In school for example, I was taught the method that gives 28.33. It wasn't until I learned programming in university that I learned the correct way!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to do the operations in a different order, we use parenthesis (brackets) around the parts to do first. The parts in parenthesis are always done before the parts outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big disadvantage of Infix Notation is hopefully clear now. The rules for evaluating it are surprisingly complex, cause a lot of confusion, and in fact most people don't understand them properly. Additionally, the need to use parentheses correctly adds another layer of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move towards understanding what Reverse Polish Notation is, keep in mind that while it seems a bit strange and un-intuitive (at first!), that Infix Notation is actually more confusing. The only reason Infix Notation seems intuitive is because you've probably been using it all your life and so it is now second nature to you. People who use Reverse Polish Notation on a daily basis find it very intuitive! Some hand-held calculators still use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Reverse Polish Notation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Infix Notation, or in fact any other notation, Reverse Polish Notation has rules for how to evaluate it. You'll need to know these rules before you can write an algorithm. The rules could either be prior knowledge or supplied by an interviewer.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "While there are operators remaining in the list, find the left-most operator. Apply it to the 2 numbers immediately before it, and replace all 3 tokens (the operator and 2 numbers) with the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in the most simplest case of 3 4 + when we reach + we can replace 3 4 + with it's result 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the input was valid, this rule will always work and leave a single number that should be returned. The leftmost operator that hasn't yet been removed will always have 2 numbers immediately before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully the advantage is obvious now. Reverse Polish Notation doesn't require brackets, and the rules for evaluating it are far simpler. In-fact, our equivalent question for Infix Notation is much more difficult than this one!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach : Evaluate with Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to repeatedly delete items from the middle of a list, as this inevitably leads to O(n^2) time performance. So recall that the above algorithm scanned through the list from left to right, and each time it reached an operator, it'd replace the operator and the 2 numbers immediately before it with the result of applying the operator to the 2 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key steps of the above algorithm were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit each operator, in linear order. Finding these can be done with a linear search of the original list.\n",
    "* Get the 2 most recently seen numbers that haven't yet been replaced. These could be tracked using a Stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm would be as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stack = new Stack()\n",
    "for each token in tokens:\n",
    "    if token is a number:\n",
    "        stack.push(token)\n",
    "    else (token is operator):\n",
    "        number_2 = stack.pop()  \n",
    "        number_1 = stack.pop()\n",
    "        result = apply_operator(token, number_1, number_2)\n",
    "        stack.push(result)\n",
    "return stack.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ou might have noticed the following 2 lines of the pseudocode could look like they're around the wrong way.\n",
    "```\n",
    "number_2 = stack.pop()  \n",
    "number_1 = stack.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "They are correct though. Remember that for division and subtraction, the order of the numbers matters. i.e. 7 - 5 ≠ 5 - 7. On the Stack, we have the second on the top. So we need to reverse them before applying the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is code that uses lambda functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let nn be the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity : O(n)O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "We do a linear search to put all numbers on the stack, and process all operators. Processing an operator requires removing 2 numbers off the stack and replacing them with a single number, which is an O(1)O(1) operation. Therefore, the total cost is proportional to the length of the input array. Unlike before, we're no longer doing expensive deletes from the middle of an Array or List.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space Complexity : O(n)O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, the stack will have all the numbers on it at the same time. This is never more than half the length of the input array.\n",

    "We are given a stream of records of the price of stock at different timestamps. We need to implement some functions to get the lowest, highest, and latest price of the stock based on the records provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The records do not come in chronological order. Another record with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream, correcting the price of the previous wrong record; this correction can affect the lowest, highest, and latest price of the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example to make sure we clearly understand what this problem is asking. Suppose the stock prices in increasing order of timestamp are, [2, 10, 3, 3, 5, 9].\n",
    "Here, the lowest price of the stock is 2, the highest price is 10, and the latest price is 9.\n",

    "\n",
    "If $2^{nd}$ record is corrected from 10 to 20, then the highest price changes to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need to store all the records of the stock price and make corrections when necessary.\n",
    "We can use a hashmap to store timestamp as key and price as value, where the correction of records will only take constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to get the highest and lowest price of the stock. We could think of sorting the stock prices but when an update or an insertion of a new price is made we would need to sort the prices again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we will prefer using a data structure that allows us to track the current minimum and maximum values efficiently. **We can use a sorted set, sorted map, or min and max-heaps; the intuition will remain the same only the implementation will differ.** All these data structures keep the elements sorted, and the insertion and removal of elements take only logarithmic time.\n",

    "Now, we will use a sorted map (priceFrequency) to store the stock prices in increasing order.\n",
    "A sorted map also stores the elements as key-value pairs and keeps elements sorted on the basis of the key. Thus, we will store the price of the stocks as the key and its occurrence (count) in our records stream as the value, i.e. the sorted map maps the price to the frequency.

    "\n",
    "In this approach, again, we will use a hashmap (timestampPriceMap) to record the stock's price at each timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not necessary for us to maintain a sorted map as we did in the previous approach. Any time we need to efficiently keep track of the lowest or highest value, we should consider using a heap data structure. Here, we will store each record in 2 different heaps, a min-heap to efficiently track the lowest stock price and a max-heap to efficiently track the highest stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the real challenge will be, how to update stock prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can directly change the stock price in the hashmap, but in the heaps, we would have to pop all stock prices until the old price comes on top and then push the new price and all other popped prices back. This would make the update operation very costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to resolve this issue is every time we get a new price, we push it into each heap, and only while getting the top element we need to verify if the price is correct or outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we know which prices are outdated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we can use our hashmap (timestampPriceMap). Every time we receive a (price, timestamp) pair, we will set the value for the key (timestamp) to the given price. If the timestamp already exists in the hashmap, we overwrite the old price. So, when finding the maximum or minimum price, we will check to see if the (price, timestamp) pair on the top of the heap agrees with the price listed for the timestamp in the hashmap. If it does not, then the price is outdated, and we discard this pair and get the next top element and again check with the hashmap.\n",

    "* In the maximum / minimum function, we get the (price, timestamp) pair from the top of maxHeap / minHeap. If timestampPriceMap[timestamp] is not same as price, we discard this pair and repeat the same step again. Otherwise, return the current price.\n",

    "**Implementation**\n",
