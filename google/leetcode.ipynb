    "# 1. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) given that you can eliminate at most k obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/short1-grid.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,0]], k = 1\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10.\n",
    "The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many grid search problems where the goal is to find the shortest path, the key to solve this problem is to apply the Breadth-First Search algorithm, as opposed to the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. In this article, we will start with a classic BFS solution. Then on top of BFS, we will introduce a heuristic (greedy) strategy to speed up the algorithm, which eventually transforms our classic BFS algorithm into another classic algorithm called the A* search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 1: BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we must traverse the grid to reach a target cell, while the grid contains some obstacles. If the problem ends here, one could probably tell that this is a classic grid search problem, e.g. the problem of 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food fits the bill exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the particularity of this problem is that one can eliminate obstacles to a certain extent. This constraint complicates our problem. First of all, if there were no limit on how many obstacles we can eliminate, then the shortest distance to reach the target cell would be the Manhattan distance between the starting cell and the target cell. Likewise, if the quota to eliminate the obstacles is greater than the Manhattan distance, then the shortest distance is guaranteed to be the Manhattan distance. However, we do have a limit on the number of obstacles that we can eliminate along the way. As a result, rather than taking a straightforward path to reach the target, we have to take some detour in certain cases, which implies that we need to explore all possible directions while respecting the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring, we refer to the BFS strategy, rather than DFS. The BFS algorithm works like detecting an object with sonar. A sound wave propagages in all directions with equal speed. At any given moment, all the objects that the sound wave reaches have the same distance to the source of the sound. On the other hand, as soon as the sound wave reaches the object, the path is guaranteed to be the shortest, since the distance is proportional to the time, the more time it takes, the longer the distance is.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_bfs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above intuition of the BFS algorithm, we can rest assured that as soon as we reach the target, the path that leads to the target is the shortest. This is also the rationale for why we should employ the BFS strategy rather than DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the canonical implementation of the BFS algorithm, we would employ a queue data structure to maintain the order of exploration. Each element in the queue normally contains two pieces of information: the current position and the distance traveled so far from the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our problem here, we need another piece of information, which is the remaining quota that we can use to eliminate the obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the coordinates, the obstacle elimination quota uniquely constitutes a state during our BFS exploration. For example, in the following graph, we demonstrate two different paths between the start cell and an intermediate cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_bfs_two_paths.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the obstacle elimination quota, we would only visit the intermediate cell once, while only one of the two paths can lead us to the target, since in one of the paths we don't have sufficient quota to get through. Therefore, it is critical to keep the quota information, so that we can revisit the same cell with different quotas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to implement a BFS algorithm. We provide a template to do so in the Queue and Stack Explore Card.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we provide some sample implementations together with the tweak we mentioned in the above section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break down the algorithm into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main body of the BFS algorithm consists of a loop around a queue, as well as a set called seen which keeps track of all the states visited along the way so that we don't visit the same state twice. A state refers to a unique combination of coordinates and the remaining quota.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At each iteration of the loop, we pop out one element from the queue. The element contains the distance from the starting point as well as the current state which includes the current coordinate and the remaining quotas to eliminate obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within the same iteration, we evaluate the next moves starting from the popped element. Each move results in a new state and the state is valid if it is within the grid boundaries and has not been visited before. Each valid state is pushed into the queue for later iterations. Meanwhile, we also need to mark the state as visited by adding the state to the seen states set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At any iteration, if we have reached our target, we can return immediately from the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: before running the BFS traversal, we also perform a quick check to see if we have sufficient quotas to take the most direct path from start to finish regardless of the number of obstacles. If so, the shortest distance to reach the target is the Manhattan distance between the starting cell and the target cell.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the above BFS approach, one might notice that when at any specific position, we would systematically explore the surrounding neighbors in all four directions, due to the nature of BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the action might seem conterintuitive or sub-optimal. Since the destination is located in the lower-right corner of the grid, in order to find the shortest path, the optimal directions to explore should be either right or down, rather than left or up.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/Figures/1293/1293_next_steps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the above image, the optimal steps to explore should be the ones in green (right and down), rather than the ones in orange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one idea to improve our BFS approach is to prioritize exploring the most promising directions at each step. Through prioritization, we can speed up the algorithm by reducing the time spent exploring less promising paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea leads us to the A* search algorithm, which is yet another classic path finding algorithm that uses a heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we cannot exclude (or prune) those less promising directions, otherwise we might miss the correct path because sometimes we have to take a detour in order to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A* (pronounced as A star) is also known as an informed search algorithm or best-first search. Because at each step of exploration, it makes the best and informed decision on the next steps, i.e. it prioritizes the steps that are the most promising. Specifically, this prioritization strategy can be expressed as A* selects a path that minimizes the following function:f(n) = g(n) + h(n)f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "nn: a specific step during the exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "g(n)g(n): the cost to reach the step nn. Here, the cost refers to the distance traveled so far to the step nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "h(n)h(n): a heuristic estimation on the cost to reach the destination from the step nn. Here, the cost refers to the distance ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "f(n)f(n): the estimated total cost to reach the destination if one takes the step nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the defined function, A* algorithm has a deterministic way to evaluate each potential step, and then make what it believes to be the best decision at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem boils down to defining the above functions for our scenario, in order to apply the A* algorithm. Specifically, g(n)g(n) would be the number of steps that one has taken to reach nn. And h(n)h(n) would be the Manhattan distance from nn to the destination, which is the shortest path to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important property of our heuristic h(n)h(n) function is that the function should be admissible, i.e. it never overestimates the cost. Otherwise, it could not guarantee that the path we find is the shortest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the admissible property, let us take a metaphor. In a football tournament, we want to select the best team in the end. If we overestimate the incompetence of a team, i.e. we downplay the potential of the team, we might prematurely disqualify or ignore the team. As a result, we may predict that a not-so-good team will win the championship, while in reality, the team we disqualified or ignored happens to be the best team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm provides a more optimized path selection strategy, on top of the BFS approach. Therefore, we can implement the A* algorithm while keeping the bulk of our previous BFS approach intact. We will still use a queue to keep track of the order of visits. And we will still use a set to keep track of the visited states so that we do not revisit any previously explored paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, here are the modifications that we will make:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than using a normal queue, we use a priority queue to store the order of visits. The order of visits is based on the estimated total cost function f(n)f(n) that we defined. With the priority queue, the step that has potentially the lowest cost will be visited first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each element in the queue, we add one more piece of information which is the estimated total cost to reach the destination at each step. This estimation will be used to prioritize each potential next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We add another heuristic condition that allows us to determine the length of the shortest path without exploration. The condition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * At any step, if the remaining quota to eliminate the obstacles is larger than the length of the estimated shortest path (i.e. manhattan distance between the current step and the destination), then the length of the remaining path is the manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The condition can also be interpreted as if we have sufficient capacity to remove any obstacle along the way, we will simply take the shortest path to reach the destination, without the need for further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We apply the condition at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let NN be the number of cells in the grid, and KK be the quota to eliminate obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity: O\\big(N \\cdot K \\cdot \\log{(N \\cdot K)} \\big)O(N⋅K⋅log(N⋅K))\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct a BFS traversal in the grid. In the worst case, we will visit each cell in the grid. And each cell can be visited at most KK times, with different quotas of obstacle elimination. Therefore, the total number of visits would be N \\cdot KN⋅K.\n",
